## Context

### Problem

This project was presented to us by [Coris Innovation](https://www.corisinnovation.com)  via [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/), it's objective is for us to improve Coris's work on their new project, SportShield.

SportShield is a device intented to help customers secure their skis or snowboard when they are not using them (i.e. during lunchtime). 
The product lock the object(s) in place using a cable for physicla security(for now), that cable will lock itself to protect from unwinding when locked. 
The product is also equiped with an alarm system, when it mouvement (i.e. theft attempt). 
This is linked together via a mobile app that allows you to lock/unlock the device, stop the alarm or check the devices position on a map.

### Target and Stakeholders

This document is addressed to the Tech Lead, the Software Engineer, the Quality Assurance and the client (Coris Innovation). This document will describe the projects expected specifications and will act as a guideline for the developers.
